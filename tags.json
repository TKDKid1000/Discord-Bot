These are clearly linux prefixes if you haven\u0027t seen so already. `./` refers to the current path, `.` means current directory path, and the `/` at the end means that you are referencing a directory and not a file. Then you are \"running an executable\" in the current directory by doing `./command`, or better: `./executable`. In a similar vein, `~/` means home directory. `~` meaning home path, and, again, `/` meaning its a directory. So all your \"tags\" are stored in the home directory, becuase, reasons? idk. But yea, now you understand. Bye!"
